### Project Description

The project has as goal to contribute making data from BRIS (Fire Reporting System) more available for analytics and dissemination. This involves developing a solution that offers search and filtering of data in Elasticsearch with a simplified BI tool to produce graphs and reports from the data. These searches and reports have to be persisted and made shareable within the solution between users.

Joacim assisted with the technical examinations of the solution and created architectural documentation for the technical issues and possible solutions regarding Elasticsearch, web services, data models and access control. He developed a prototype for search and filtering against the current search index. The result was a dynamically configurable web application where you could combine most ways of filtering data arbitrarily and get results from the current solutions data source.

Information gathering, technical considerations and documentation of possible solutions after solution requirements. Develop web application in Vue.js with the use of the Elasticsearch API, models for dynamic building of search and filters. Able to deliver complete features or mock up of solution during time sensitive period for user testing.

| Fields of competency | Angular 4, React, Docker, Typescript, Javascript, HTML5, Java, Spring, CSS, SCSS, Git |

### Project Description

The National Data Directory is an overview showing which data the various public agencies have registered, how they are connected and what they mean. The National Data Directory makes it possible to search in the information registered with the public agencies and use the information for analytic purposes. The project is an important building block for the SKATE directorates' plans in regards to digital agenda and the implementation of "once only" principle in government services.

Joacim developed new features in the search application for datasets in the National Datadirectory. This includes new website featues, search optimization, new APIs and generation of API documentation. This helped the team deliver milestones on time and laid groundwork to ease operations and requirements after project completion.
Joacim helped implement and complete the MVP of the registration application for datasets to be entered into the National Data Directory. This resulted in a working product which was launched soon after. He worked on implementing the registration form after design requirements, and the rewriting of core functionality to remove technical debt and create a more robust product.

Joacim assisted the team mainly as a front end developer, but also as a solution architect for certain services and optimizations.

Development of web applications in React and Angular 4, APIs in Java and Spring, search engine optimization in Elasticsearch. Design and implementation of alternative solutions in a time pressed environment and groundwork for easier operations and further development in a solution with much technical debt.

| Fields of competency | PL/SQL, Java, Apache Camel, Git, Centura Team Developer, Spring, REST. |

### Project Description

Development and operations of SPORT (Statoil’s Planning and Operational system for Offshore, Refinery and Terminals) and related interfaces within the oil and gas commodity trading application portfolio. The portfolio consisting of highly business critical systems supporting Statoil’s daily turnover of 2 million barrels of oil.

Implementing new features and fixing errors, with a focus on removing pain points for the users in a legacy application. He also worked as liaison to another development team, where he contributed as a solution architect. There he designed and implemented solutions for interfaces to support new applications in other projects. As needs and workload for this increased he guided coworkers in new technology and managed the completion of these tasks for several solutions. Good modelling of these solutions allowed tasks to be easily shared and understood by both product owners and coworkers.

As a result of his work new features, and old problems were fixed, easing the users day to day operations. Groundwork for retiring a legacy application was laid. Allowed old systems, using new technology, to communicate with other applications bringing value to previously isolated data and easing workload for other projects.

Development in PL/SQL (Oracle), Centura Team Developer, design and development of interfaces using Java, Spring and Apache Camel,
2nd line support for users, performing releases of business-critical applications.
